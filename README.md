# Webdesign
Basic Web Design Practice. Copying the html boiler plate(without inspecting the site). I was not attempting to do a "code in teh dark" of 
the site, but instead, used it as practice in the basics of html. 
Therefore not all attributes will be identical(e.g. list tags in place of paragraph tags) in order to show and practice diversity in the
code.
